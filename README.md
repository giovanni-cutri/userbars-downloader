# userbars-downloader
 
The *userbars-be.py* and *userbars-name.py* files download every userbar from the websites *www.userbars.be* and *www.userbars.name*, respectively; they generate two separate JSON files with the metadata associated to the userbars.

More specifically, the following information is saved:
- **Userbar unique identifier (id)**
- **Download link**
- **Title**
- **Uploader name**
- **Upload date**
- **Category**

The downloaded userbars get saved in the *userbars-be/* and *userbars-name/* folders.
